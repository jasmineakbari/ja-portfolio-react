# JA-Portfolo-React

## Description
This is my Web Developer Portfolio via React. It conditionally renders all the sections of my original created portfolio using only HTML, CSS, and JS depending on which navigation item is clicked. You can view a section About me, my projects, resume and a contact form that validates user input.
